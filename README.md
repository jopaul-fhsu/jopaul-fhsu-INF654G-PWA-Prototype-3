# INF654G-PWA-Prototype-3

## Overview of the Development Process

To transition the Contact List PWA from JSON storage to Firebase and IndexedDB, I started by integrating IndexedDB to handle client-side storage, ensuring offline access and faster local operations. I designed a structured database schema within IndexedDB to store contact details effectively. Then, I set up Firebase as the cloud-based backend, using Firestore to manage and synchronize contact data in real time. I wrote synchronization logic to ensure that any changes made offline would be stored in IndexedDB and automatically pushed to Firebase once the device reconnected to the internet. Finally, I tested the entire system to confirm that it handled data consistency, resolved conflicts smoothly, and provided a seamless experience for users whether they were online or offline.
